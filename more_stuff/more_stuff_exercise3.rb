# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

puts "It's a process to help you manage errors in a practical way. Ruby reserves the
word 'rescue' which you can use so your program knows what to do if bad info corrupts it
to keep the program running.  Ruby also has an Exception class to make handling errors easier."
